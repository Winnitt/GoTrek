Our Aim of building a trekking website is to encourage mental and physical fitness.Our website will contain all services for trekking. Our website will be one-stop shop
that will include renting and buying trekking accessories. Some of the topics we address:
• Trekkers can apply for insurance (only if injury occurs during trekking).
• Various membership plans, medical check ups and medical pass.
• Trekkers can plan their trek according to their destinations.
• It could be a place where you find friends, and it could be a journey.
• Our website will connect trekkers from different parts of the country and thus
trekking can create memories and lifelong friendship.
• We also have family treks to magnify the positive effects of trekking with your
children. This deepens learning on a trek and creates some unforgettable memories.
